# Unicode

The Unicode Consortium is the standards body for the internationalization of software and services.

The Unicode Standard consists of:
- the [core specification](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode16.0.0/core-spec/), giving the general principles, requirements for conformance, and guidelines for implementers;
- the [code charts](https://www.unicode.org/charts/), showing representative glyphs for all the Unicode characters;
- the Unicode Standard Annexes, supplying detailed normative information about particular aspects of the standard; and
- the Unicode Character Database (UCD), supplying normative and informative data for implementers.

Unicode also publishes [ICU](https://icu.unicode.org/), a library implementing Unicode support for C/C++ and Java programming languages.
