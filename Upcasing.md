# Rules for processing Greek capitalization: Accents and Dialytika

*NOTE:* the following is only about *monotonic* Greek.

When writing Greek in all uppercase letters (e.g., for titles, signs, or emphasis), there are a few key orthographic rules to follow, particularly concerning accents (τόνοι) and the dialytika (διαλυτικά - the two dots placed horizontally above a vowel, like an umlaut).

## Rule 1: Remove Accents (Τόνοι)

The simplest rule is that **all accents (τόνοι) are removed when a word is written in uppercase.**

*   Modern Greek uses a single accent mark (τόνος), which can appear on one of the last three syllables of a word.

Examples:
*   `άνθρωπος` becomes `ΑΝΘΡΩΠΟΣ`
*   `Ελλάδα` becomes `ΕΛΛΑΔΑ`
*   `τραπέζι` becomes `ΤΡΑΠΕΖΙ`

**Exception**: the disjoint preposition `ή` (a single-letter word) *keeps* the accent and becomes `Ή`.

## Rule 2: Keep Dialytika (Διαλυτικά)

The dialytika ( `¨` ) is used over an iota (`ι`) or upsilon (`υ`) to indicate that it should be pronounced as a separate vowel sound, rather than forming a diphthong with the preceding vowel.

**If a lowercase word already has a dialytika on an `ι` or `υ`, that dialytika is kept when the word is capitalized.**

Examples:
*   `γαϊδούρι` (ga-i-doúri) becomes `ΓΑΪΔΟΥΡΙ`
*   `προϋπόθεση` (pro-y-póthesi) becomes `ΠΡΟΫΠΟΘΕΣΗ`

## Rule 3: Add Dialytika, due to the removal of accents

Crucially, **dialytika MUST BE ADDED to an uppercase Iota (`Ι`) or Upsilon (`Υ`) if:**

1.  it is preceded by another vowel (`Α, Ε, Η, Ο, Ω`); AND
2.  in the lowercase form, these two vowels were pronounced separately (i.e., did not form a diphthong), because the preceding vowel was accented; AND
3.  without the dialytika in uppercase, the vowel pair would misleadingly look like a standard diphthong (e.g., `ΑΙ, ΕΙ, ΟΙ, ΑΥ, ΕΥ, ΟΥ`).

The purpose of adding the dialytika in such cases is to preserve the correct pronunciation by preventing the vowels from being read as a single diphthong sound after the accent (which originally separated them) has been removed.

Examples:

*   `τσάι` (tsá-i - tea): The accent on `ά` separates it from `ι`.
    In uppercase: `ΤΣΑΪ`. (Without dialytika, `ΤΣΑΙ` would look like the diphthong /e/).
*   `Μάιος` (Má-ios - May): The accent on `ά` separates it from `ι`.
    In uppercase: `ΜΑΪΟΣ`.
*   `νεράιδα` (nerá-i-da - fairy): The accent on `ά` separates it from `ι`.
    In uppercase: `ΝΕΡΑΪΔΑ`.

Note that regular diphthongs in lowercase do **not** require adding dialytika in uppercase.

Examples:

*   `Αιγαίο` becomes `ΑΙΓΑΙΟ` (`ΑΙ` is a diphthong)
*   `Ευρώπη` becomes `ΕΥΡΩΠΗ` (`ΕΥ` is a diphthong)
*   `αυτοκίνητο` becomes `ΑΥΤΟΚΙΝΗΤΟ` (`ΑΥ` is a diphthong)

## Summary of Dialytika on Uppercase Ι/Υ

*   If lowercase has `αϊ, εϊ, ηϊ, οϊ, ωϊ, υϊ` or `αϋ, εϋ, ηϋ, οϋ, ωϋ`, then uppercase keeps it: `ΑΪ, ΕΪ, ΗΪ, ΟΪ, ΩΪ, ΥΪ` or `ΑΫ, ΕΫ, ΗΫ, ΟΫ, ΩΫ`.
*   If lowercase has an accented vowel followed by `ι`/`υ` that is pronounced separately (e.g., `άι, έι, όι, άυ, έυ`), then uppercase ADDS the dialytika to the `Ι`/`Υ`: `ΑΪ, ΕΪ, ΟΪ, ΑΫ, ΕΫ`.

This system ensures that the pronunciation cues present in lowercase (either through existing dialytika or the placement of accents) are not lost when words are converted to uppercase.
