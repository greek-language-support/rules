# Greek language basics

## Introduction - concepts

Greek is one of the oldest forms of alphabet in existence,
with over thirty four centuries of written records.  
Just like English, Greek uses a set of characters that can be typed,
displayed, and manipulated.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the elements you'll find in Greek
text on a computer:

### Uppercase and Lowercase Letters

Greek has both uppercase (κεφαλαία) and lowercase (πεζά) letters,
just like English. There are both forms of each letter, and there
is the special case where lowercase sigma (σ) takes a different form
at the end of a word, becoming "final sigma" (ς).  Capitalization of
the first letter of a word only happens at the beginning of sentences
and on proper nouns.  Whole words can also be capitalized for emphasis.

### Words

Greek text, like many other languages, is composed of words formed by
combining these letters. Spaces are used to separate words, making
the text readable and allowing readers to identify individual units
of meaning.

### Punctuation

Greek utilizes a variety of punctuation marks to structure sentences
and convey meaning, quite similar to English.

### Diacritics

Greek uses diacritics, for example accents to indicate stressed syllables
and diaeresis to indicate that a vowel is pronounced separately and not
as part of a diphthong.

In modern (monotonic) Greek there are:

* Tonos (τόνος), which looks like a short, angled line placed above
a vowel (i.e., ά, έ, ή, ί, ό, ύ, ώ).

* Diaeresis (διαλυτικά), which are two dots placed above a vowel
(i.e., ϊ, ϋ). 

## Letters

## Uppercase or capitals (formally majuscule) (κεφαλαία)

Α, Β, Γ, Δ, Ε, Ζ, Η, Θ, Ι, Κ, Λ, Μ, Ν, Ξ, Ο, Π, Ρ, Σ, Τ, Υ, Φ, Χ, Ψ, Ω 

## Lowercase (formally minuscule) (πεζά)

α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ, η, θ, ι, κ, λ, μ, ν, ξ, ο, π, ρ, σ, τ, υ, φ, χ, ψ, ω, ς

## Additional, for numerals

- digamma (6)
- koppa (90)
- sampi (900)

## Diacritics

### Monotonic

- accent (τόνος)
- diaeresis (διαλυτικά)

### Polytonic / Ancient

- accents: acute (οξεία), circumflex (περισπωμένη), grave (βαρεία)
- breathings: smooth (ψιλή), rough (δασεία)
- diaeresis (διαλυτικά)
- coronis (κορωνίς)

## Punctuation

- period / full stop (τελεία) **.**
- comma (κόμμα) **,**
- question mark (ερωτηματικό) **;**
- exclamation mark (θαυμαστικό) **!**
- semicolon (άνω τελεία) **·**
- colon (άνω και κάτω τελεία) **:**
- ellipsis (αποσιωπητικά) **…**
- quotation marks (εισαγωγικά) **«** **»**

# Basic Rules Regarding Accents (monotonic)

- Accents appear only on vowels and they indicate the stressed syllable.
- Generally, each word has only one accent.
  - Single-syllable words do not have an accent.
    - Exception: the conjuction ή
  - There might be cases where a second accent is placed at the last syllable.
- Words written entirely in uppercase generally do not use accents.
